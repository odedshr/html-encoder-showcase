# html-encoder-showcase

A few quick examples written using my [HTML-encoder VSCode extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=odedshr.html-encoder). Its code is available on [github](https://github.com/odedshr/html-encoder) too.

To view the example, simply put the pre-compiled `out/www` folder in a web-server.
To update the `typescript` or `scss` files run `npm run build` or `npm run build:watch` for continuos build.
To run a simple local server run `npm run start`.
